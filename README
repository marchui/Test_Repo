This is the Test_Repo repository. I am using this repository to experience github and to upload some of the projects I've done. In this repo, you will find folders that contain various projects I've done from different situation. 

They are all Java projects. There isn't much to running these projects. Just find the file, compile it using 'javac' and run them using the 'java' command. Enjoy!
