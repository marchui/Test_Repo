This is the Test_Repo repository. I am basically using this repository to test out github and to upload some of the projects I've done. In this repo, you will find a few folders that contain varies projects I've done from different situation. Some from school, some from work, and maybe others. They are all Java projects. There isn't much to running these projects. Just find the file, compile it using 'javac' and run them using the 'java' command. Enjoy!
